      Sample Health Data Frontend
      <p>An Angular web-app desigend to consume the sample health data API.</p>
    </summary>
    <p>Imagine a hospital administrator who was to decide how to allocate funding for serving non-English speaking patients. This app provides a view for that administrator to see which language-speaking patients use what hospitals.</p>
    <p>I created this Angular app in my personal time to consume the API I made for my LaunchCode capstone project. As the API is not hosted, the demo app instead consumes a flat file version of the data and CRUD functionality has been disabled.</p>
    <p>At this point, the map page mereley consists of a basic Leaflet.js map of the region. Down the road, I plan to add data visualizations to the map that would aid our imaginary administrator.</p>

      Sample Health Data API
      <p>My capstone project for LaunchCode, this is an ASP.NET RestAPI written in C# with a MongoDB.</p>
    </summary>
    <p>Imagine a hospital administrator who was to decide how to allocate funding for serving non-English speaking patients. This API is desigend to serve the data that an administrator could use to see which language-speaking patients use what hospitals.</p>
    <p>None of the data belongs to real people. But the data is based on real standards and statistics.
        <ul>
          <li>The hospitals were selected because they are the largest in the region by number of beds.</li>
          <li>The data fields were derived from a CCD-XML template, in following C-CDA 2.0, a healthcare data standard certified by the American National Standards Institute.</li>
          <li>The fake names were generated using the Python names library. I found that the names appeared too real, so I appended the prefix "fake-" to eliminate any confusion of this data for the data of real people.</li>
